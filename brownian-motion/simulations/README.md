Brownian Motion in Cells
=======================

Quick explanation of the simulation files
-----------------------------------------

The file 'Particle.py' contains the definition of the Particle class used in the
simulations. The rest of the files are simulations. The brownian\_simple\_\*
files are quick dimensionless examples of random walks, whereas the other
simulations represent the actual systems being studied.

Running the simuations
-------------------------

These simulations require numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. Running them is
incredibly straightforward and simple:  
$ python script\_name.py [options]  
To see the available options, use the '-h' flag on the scripts:  
$ python script\_name.py -h
