Brownian Motion in Cells
=======================

Analysis scripts.
-----------------------------------------

The file 'brownian\_motion\_cells.py' contains common functions used throughout
the analysis. The rest of scripts are for running some analysis or displaying
plots.

Running the analysis scripts
-------------------------

These simulations require numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. Running them is
incredibly straightforward and simple:  
$ python script\_name.py [options]  
To see the available options, use the '-h' flag on the scripts:  
$ python script\_name.py -h

The format of the input data recorded by the particle tracking software can be
found at the [BMC Software](http://labs.physics.berkeley.edu/mediawiki/index.php/BMC_Software#Saved_Data_Formatting)
page on the Advanced Lab wiki.
